Our **dynamics-based machine learning algorithm for nonlinear reduced models from data** has just appeared in **Nature Communications**:

M. Cenedese, J. Axås, B. Bäuerlein, K. Avila and G. Haller. Data-driven modeling and prediction of non-linearizable dynamics via spectral submanifolds. *Nature Communications*, **13** (2022) 872. [<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">doi</span>: 10.1038/s41467-022-28518-y](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28518-y)

This research is also featured in this [press release](https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2022/02/predicting-complex-dynamics-from-data.html) of ETH Zurich.
