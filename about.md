I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [Institute for Mechanical Systems](https://imes.ethz.ch/) in the [Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering](https://mavt.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) under the mentorship of [George Haller](https://georgehaller.com). I completed my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering at [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/en/) and I obtained M.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Politecnico di Milano and [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/index.php?lang=en), where I was also part of [Alta Scuola Politecnica](https://www.asp-poli.it/). I attained the doctorate in 2021 from ETH Zurich at the Department of Mechanical and Process Engineering under the supervision of George Haller and co-supervision of [Melih Eriten](http://friction.engr.wisc.edu/home), with a thesis entitled [A Geometric Approach to Nonlinear Mechanical Vibrations: from Analytic to Data-driven Methods](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/528996).
